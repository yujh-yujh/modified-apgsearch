Modified version of a rather outdated version of apgsearch. For the most recent ones, see https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera

Note: these scripts need python 2.x and golly 2.x.

This version of apgsearch can deal with rules like http://catagolue.hatsya.com/census/b2ce3ajk4ak5ajk6e78s2ei3aejkr4-cny5-e6-a78/C1 and doesn't get stuck although an explosion occurs nearly 1 in 3000 soups
